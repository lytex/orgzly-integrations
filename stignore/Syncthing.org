My setup is currently
*** Computer
~ = /home/$USER
└── ~/org/
    ├── code/ (Soft link to ~/code)
    ├── Documents/ (Soft link to ~/Documents)
    └── regular org files and folders

*** Android devices
~ = /storage/emulated/0
├── ~/orgzly/
│   └── regular org files and folders
├── ~/code/
└── ~/Documents/

*** orgzly
orgzly links that are not links to existing notebooks are prepended by =/storage/emulated/0=.
A way to make links work in both a computer with emacs and orgzly (e.g. =file:Documents/MyDoc.pdf=) is to have on your computer a link to ~/Documents and ~/code *inside* org folder, so that links are interpreted as relative to /home/$USER/org in your computer, and relative to /storage/emulated/0 (or equivalent user root directory) in your Android devices
